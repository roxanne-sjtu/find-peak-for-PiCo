# find-peak-for-PiCo/For SJTU muon physics group Positronium QED varify program
This repository is developed aiming at find the valid peak of gamma signal from a large number of invalid signals(like 1 million)

To use this code, please editted for your personal aim. For example, in our find_peak_for_text.cpp(example), we only choose entries that  CH A,B has signal and only choose the first peak for  CH C,D.

This code is developed based on GitHub link: https://github.com/claydergc/find-peaks. We mainly develope find_peak_for_test.cpp (example), the Peakfinder.cpp Peakfinder.h are come from this github link.

We also independently developed the function for finding the peak range.
